This repository provides the official implementation of the GeminiMol model, training data, and utilities. In this work, we propose a hybrid contrastive learning framework, which conducts **inter-molecular contrastive learning** by multiple projection heads of **conformational space similarities (CSS)**. Please also refer to our [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202403998) for a detailed description of GeminiMol.    

Click [here to **Ouroboros**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/Ouroboros), which is an unified framework that **seamlessly integrates representation learning with molecular generation**! It upgrades the molecular similarity learning protocol in GeminiMol and further improves the performance in virtual screening and property modeling, and more importantly, it can be used directly for molecule generation!     

## 💗 Motivation  

The **molecular representation model** is an emerging artificial intelligence technology for extracting features of small molecules. Inspired by the dynamics of small molecules in solution, introducing the **conformational space profile** into molecular representation models is a promising aim. The conformational space profile covers the heterogeneity of molecule properties, such as the multi-target mechanism of drug action, recognition of different biomolecules, dynamics in cytoplasm and membrane, which may facilitate further downstream application and generalization capability of molecular representation model.   

## 💡 Highlight

* GeminiMol exhibits the capability to **identify molecular pairs with similar 3D active conformers**, even in scenarios where their 2D structures exhibit significant differences.     
* GeminiMol was pre-trained on only 37,336 molecular structures, yet it can **generalize** to zero-shot and few-shot tasks involving millions of molecules.    
* GeminiMol shown the **balanced performance** across various applications, including virtual screening, target identification, and molecular property modeling.        

## 🔔 News

## 😫 Limitations

* Note that, the conformational space profile is **not a panacea** for drug discovery. For a portion of tasks, the 2D structure of a compound already contains sufficient information to establish structure-activity relationships, rendering the introduction of the conformational space profile inconsequential for these tasks.       
* The evaluation of intermolecular similarity is not limited to pharmacophore similarity in 3D conformational space and maximum common substructure similarity in 2D structures. By incorporating **additional intermolecular similarity metrics** during pre-training, we can further enrich the knowledge that the model can learn, such as molecular fingerprints and molecular surface potentials.   
* Due to computational resource limitations, we only included 39,290 molecules in our pre-training. It is foreseeable that incorporating **more molecular structures** during pre-training could further enhance the performance of GeminiMol, particularly when guided by drug-target relationships to obtain high-quality data.

## 📓 Application

As a molecular representation model, GeminiMol finds applications in **ligand-based virtual screening, target identification, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)** modeling of small molecular drugs.   

![benchmark](imgs/benchmark.png)

We have provided Cross-Encoder and GeminiMol models that can be used directly for inference. Here, we demonstrate the utilization of GeminiMol for virtual screening, target identification, and molecular property modeling.      

Please note that while molecular fingerprints are considered simple molecular representation methods, they are an indispensable baseline (see our [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202403998)). When conducting your drug development project, we recommend exploring ECFP4, CombineFP, and GeminiMol that are provided simultaneously in our `PharmProfiler.py` and various molecular property modeling scripts.     

<details>
<summary>Virtual Screening and Target Identification</summary>
<br>

In concept, molecules share similar conformational space also share similar biological activities, allowing us to predict the similarity of biological activities between molecules by comparing the similarity of GeminiMol encodings.     

Here, we introduce the ``PharmProfiler.py``, a novel approach that employs the GeminiMol encoding to establish pharmacological profiles and facilitate the search for molecules with specific properties in chemical space.    

``PharmProfiler.py`` offers the capability to conduct ligand-based virtual screening using commercially available compound libraries. Furthermore, it enables target identification through ligand similarity analysis by leveraging comprehensive drug-target relationship databases.    

To support experimentation, we have included a collection of diverse commercial compound libraries and drug-target relationship databases, conveniently located in the `${geminimol_data}/compound_library/` directory.     

> 1. Prepare the pharmacological profile and compound libraries

To define a pharmacological profile, you will need to input a `profile.csv` file, which should have the following format:   

``` 
SMILES,Label
C=CC(=O)N[C@@H]1CN(c2nc(Nc3cn(C)nc3OC)c3ncn(C)c3n2)C[C@H]1F,1.0
C=CC(=O)Nc1cccc(Nc2nc(Nc3ccc(N4CCN(C(C)=O)CC4)cc3OC)ncc2C(F)(F)F)c1,1.0
C#Cc1cccc(Nc2ncnc3cc(OCCOC)c(OCCOC)cc23)c1,1.0
COC(=O)CCC/N=C1\SCCN1Cc1ccccc1,0.4
C=C(C)[C@@H]1C[C@@H](CC2(CC=C(C)C)C(=O)C(C(CC(=O)O)c3ccccc3)=C3O[C@@H](C)[C@@H](C)C(=O)C3=C2O)C1(C)C,-0.8
C/C(=C\c1ncccc1C)[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2O[C@]2(C)CCC[C@H](C)[C@H](O)[C@@H](C)C(=O)C(C)(C)[C@@H](O)CC(=O)O1,-0.5
```

The "Label" column signifies the weight assigned to the reference compound. Positive values indicate that the selected compounds should bear resemblance to the reference compound, while negative values imply that the selected compounds should be dissimilar to the reference compound. Typically, positive values are assigned to **active** compounds, whereas negative values are assigned to **inactive** compounds or those causing **side effects**.   

The compound libraries are also stored in CSV format in the `${geminimol_data}/compound_library/` directory. It is requried to maintain consistency between the SMILES column name in the `profile.csv` file and the compound library.    

> 2. Perform the PharmProfiler

To perform virtual screening, the following command can be used.   

Here, `profile_set` represents the provided pharmacological profile by the user, `keep_top` indicates the number of compounds to be outputted in the end, and `probe_cluster` determines whether compounds with the same weight should be treated as a cluster. Compounds within the same cluster will be compared individually with the query mol, and the highest similarity score will be taken as the score of query mol.   

We have provided a processed version of the commercial Specs and ChemDiv compound library at the `${geminimol_data}/compound_library/specs.csv` and `${geminimol_data}/compound_library/ChemDiv.csv`, which contained 335,212 and 1,755,930 purchasable compounds.   

``` shell
export job_name="Virtual_Screening"
export profile_set="profile.csv" # SMILES (same to compound library) and Label (requried)
export compound_library="${geminimol_data}/compound_library/ChemDiv.csv" 
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in the compound_library
export weight_column="Label" # weights for profiles
export keep_top=1000
export probe_cluster="Yes"
python -u ${geminimol_app}/PharmProfiler.py "${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" "${job_name}" "${smiles_column}" "${compound_library}" "${profile_set}:${weight_column}" "${keep_top}"  "${probe_cluster}"
```

To perform target identification, the compound library can be replaced with the `${geminimol_data}/compound_library/DTIDB.csv`, which contains drug-target relationships. This is a processed version of the BindingDB database, which contains 2,159,221 target-ligand paris.     

``` shell
export job_name="Target_Identification"
export profile_set="profile.csv" # Ligand_SMILES (same to compound library), and Label (requried)
export compound_library="${geminimol_data}/compound_library/DTIDB.csv" 
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in the compound_library
export weight_column="Label" # weights for profiles
export keep_top=2000
export probe_cluster="No"
python -u ${geminimol_app}/PharmProfiler.py "${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" "${job_name}" "${smiles_column}" "${compound_library}" "${profile_set}:${weight_column}" "${keep_top}"  "${probe_cluster}"
```

After the initial run of PharmProfiler, a extracted GeminiMol feature file will be generated in the `${geminimol_data}/compound_library/`. Subsequent screening tasks on the same compound library can benefit from PharmProfiler automatically reading the feature file, which helps to accelerate the running speed.

<summary>Molecular Proptery Modeling (QSAR and ADMET)</summary>
<br>

> 1. Prepare your datasets

Before conducting molecular property modeling, it is crucial to carefully prepare your data, which includes compound structure pre-processing and dataset splitting.     

Firstly, you need to clarify the chirality and protonation states of molecules in the dataset, which can be done using chemical informatics tools such as RDKit or Schrödinger software package. Typically, omitting pre-processing will not result in an error, but it may potentially impair the performance of GeminiMol.    

The processed data should be saved in CSV file format, containing at least one column for **`SMILES`** and one column for **`Labels`**. Subsequently, utilize the following command for skeleton splitting. You can modify the script to change the splitting ratio, where by default, 70% of the dataset is used for training and 30% for validation and testing.     

``` shell
export dataset_path="data.csv"
export dataset_name="My_QSAR"
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export label_column="Label" # Specify the column name in datasets
python -u ${geminimol_app}/utils/dataset_split.py "${dataset_path}" "${dataset_name}" "${smiles_column}" "${label_column}"
mkdir ${dataset_name}
mv ${dataset_name}_scaffold_*.csv ${dataset_name}/
export task=${dataset_name}
```

> 2. Training the molecular property prediction model

We have presented three approaches for molecular property modeling, namely AutoQSAR (broad applicability, slow speed), PropDecoder (fast speed), and FineTuning (optimal performance, moderate speed).     

Given that you have enough experience with hyperparameter tuning, the attainment of optimal performance can be accomplished through the utilization of the FineTuning script to invoke GeminiMol. Also, AutoQSAR is recommended if you lack experience with hyperparameter tuning.    

> 2.1 Fine-Tuning on downstream task     

``` shell
export task="Your_Dataset" # Specify a path to your datasets (train, valid, and test)
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export label_column="Label" # Specify the column name in datasets
python -u ${geminimol_app}/FineTuning.py "${task}" "${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" "${smiles_column}" "${label_column}" "${task}_GeminiMol"
```

> 2.2 AutoQSAR (AutoGluon)   

It is recommended to try using AutoQSAR to call CombineFP or GeminiMol when you lack deep learning experience, which usually produces a model with good performance.     

``` shell
export encoder_method="${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" # only GeminiMol
```

In our paper, we introduced a powerful joint molecular fingerprint baseline method named CombineFP.In our experiments, the performance of CombineFP in molecular property modeling is very superior and we highly recommend trying CombineFP along with GeminiMol.   

``` shell
export encoder_method="ECFP4:AtomPairs:TopologicalTorsion:FCFP6" # CombineFP
```

Having defined the encoder, you can train the model to convert the encoding of the molecule into properties using AutoQSAR. In fact, a potential advantage of this over FineTuning is that it can decode diverse molecular properties based on the fixed encoding, which will speed up the efficiency of chemical space searching.    

``` shell
export task="Your_Dataset" # Specify a path to your datasets (train, valid, and test)
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export label_column="Label" # Specify the column name in datasets
python -u ${geminimol_app}/AutoQSAR.py "${task}" "${encoder_method}" "${smiles_column}" "${label_column}" "" "${task}_GeminiMol"
```

If the integration of molecular fingerprints and a pre-trained GeminiMol model is desired for training a molecular property prediction model, either PropDecoder or AutoQSAR can be employed.   

``` shell
export fingerprints="ECFP4:AtomPairs:TopologicalTorsion:FCFP6:MACCS" # CombineFP+MACCS
export encoder_method="${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol:${fingerprints}" # CombineFP+MACCS+GeminiMol
export task="Your_Dataset" # Specify a path to your datasets (train, valid, and test)
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export label_column="Label" # Specify the column name in datasets
python -u ${geminimol_app}/AutoQSAR.py "${task}" "${encoder_method}" "${smiles_column}" "${label_column}" "" "${task}_GMFP"
```

> 2.3 PropDecoder    

For the most tasks, performing fine-tuning or using AutoQSAR will give pretty good performance in molecular property modeling, so you don't need to try PropDecoder unless the first two give poor performance.

``` shell
export task="Your_Dataset" # Specify a path to your datasets (train, valid, and test)
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export label_column="Label" # Specify the column name in datasets
python -u ${geminimol_app}/PropDecoder.py "${task}" "${encoder_method}" "${smiles_column}" "${label_column}" "${task}_GeminiMol"
```

> 3. Make predictions (only for AutoQSAR or fine-Tuned models)

Next, we can load the model trained based on `AutoQSAR` and `FineTuning` to predict molecular properties in a new dataset.

``` shell
export model_path="QSAR_GeminiMol" # ${task}_GeminiMol when your build QSAR model
export encoder_method="${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" # Match to the encoders selected during QSAR model training
export extrnal_data="dataset.csv" # must contain the ${smiles_column}
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export model_type="FineTuning" # FineTuning, PropDecoder, ['LightGBM', 'LightGBMLarge', 'LightGBMXT', 'NeuralNetTorch'] for AutoQSAR
python -u ${geminimol_app}/PropPredictor.py "${model_path}" "${encoder_method}" "${extrnal_data}" "${smiles_column}" "${model_type}"
```

If you have constructed a regression model using AutoQSAR, refer to the following command.   

``` shell
export model_path="QSAR_GeminiMol" # ${task}_GeminiMol when your build QSAR model
export encoder_method="${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" # Match to the encoders selected during QSAR model training
export extrnal_data="dataset.csv" # must contain the ${smiles_column}
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export model_type="NeuralNetTorch" # ['LightGBM', 'LightGBMLarge', 'LightGBMXT', 'NeuralNetTorch'] for AutoQSAR
export task_type="regression"
python -u ${geminimol_app}/PropPredictor.py "${model_path}" "${encoder_method}" "${extrnal_data}" "${smiles_column}" "${model_type}" "${task_type}"
```

<summary>Molecular Clustering</summary>
<br>

You can use GeminiMol to cluster molecules just like molecular fingerprints!    

``` shell
export encoder_method="${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" # Match to the encoders selected during QSAR model training
export data_table="dataset.csv" # must contain the ${smiles_column}
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export output_fn="Cluster"
export cluster_num=10 # only for supervised clustering algorithm, such as K-Means
python -u ${geminimol_app}/Analyzer.py "${data_table}" "${encoder_method}" "${smiles_column}" "${output_fn}" "cluster:${cluster_num}"
```

<br>
</details>   

<details>
<summary>Extract Molecular Features (GeminiMol Encoding)</summary>
<br>

You can use GeminiMol or molecular fingerprints to extract molecular features for further analysis.    

``` shell
export encoder_method="${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" # Match to the encoders selected during QSAR model training
export data_table="dataset.csv" # must contain the ${smiles_column}
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export output_fn="${data_table%%.*}_Encoding"
python -u ${geminimol_app}/Analyzer.py "${data_table}" "${encoder_method}" "${smiles_column}" "${output_fn}" "encode"
```

If you would like to visualize a set of molecules with GeminiMol encoding, you can try the following commands.

``` shell
export encoder_method="${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol" # Match to the encoders selected during QSAR model training
export data_table="dataset.csv" # must contain the ${smiles_column}
export smiles_column="SMILES" # Specify the column name in datasets
export label_column="Label"
export output_fn="${data_table%%.*}_Plot"

> Training the Cross-Encoder

Cross-Encoder can be trained with the following code, however, it is only intended to be used as a high-accuracy predictor of intermolecular similarity rather than a model for molecular representation.   

``` shell
conda activate GeminiMol
export model_name="CrossEncoder"
export batch_size_per_gpu=200 # batch size = 200 (batch_size_per_gpu) * 4 (gpu number)
export epoch=20 # max epochs
export lr="1.0e-3" # learning rate
export label_list="MCMM1AM_MAX:LCMS2A1Q_MAX:MCMM1AM_MIN:LCMS2A1Q_MIN" # ShapeScore:ShapeAggregation:ShapeOverlap:CrossSim:CrossAggregation:CrossOverlap
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python ${geminimol_app}/CrossEncoder_Training.py  "${geminimol_data}/css_library/" "${geminimol_data}/Chem_SmELECTRA"  "${epoch}"  "${lr}"  "${batch_size_per_gpu}"  "${model_name}"  "${geminimol_data}/benchmark.json" "${label_list}"
```

> Training the GeminiMol Encoder and Decoder of CSS descriptors

We provide numerous APIs to change the network structure of GeminiMol, and you can explore the possibilities of improving the performance of GeminiMol by adding more labels to the given 8 million dataset.   

``` shell
conda activate GeminiMol
export model_name="GeminiMol"
export batch_size=512
export epoch=20 # max epochs
export patience=50 # for early stoping
export GNN='WLN' # Weisfeiler-Lehman Network (WLN)
export network="MeanMLP:2048:4:2048:None:0:5:0"
export label_dict="ShapeScore:0.2,ShapeAggregation:0.2,ShapeOverlap:0.05,ShapeDistance:0.05,CrossSim:0.15,CrossAggregation:0.15,CrossDist:0.05,CrossOverlap:0.05,MCS:0.1"
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -u ${geminimol_app}/GeminiMol_Training.py "${geminimol_data}/css_library/" "${epoch}" "${batch_size}" "${GNN}" "${network}" "${label_dict}" "${model_name}" "${patience}" "${geminimol_data}/benchmark.json"

Additionally, benchmark test scripts were provided. With this code, the community can reproduce the results reported in the paper, explore different model architectures, even incorporate additional molecular similarity data to further enhance the performance of the models. 

> Benchmarking molecular fingerprints and GeminiMol on virutual screening and target identification

For each molecular fingerprint, we used all supported similarity metrics, including Tanimoto, Cosine, and Tversky. For the GeminiMol model, in addition to the projected heads used in pre-training, we introduced similarities between molecular representation vectors, including Cosine and Pearson. It is worth noting that in practice we cannot be sure which combination of molecular fingerprints and similarity metrics is optimal, and therefore each combination is considered an independent method in benchmarking.    

``` shell
conda activate GeminiMol
# benchmarking Fixed GeminiMol models and Fingerprints
for task in "DUDE" "LIT-PCBA" "TIBD" # zero-shot tasks
    do
for model_name in "FCFP6" "MACCS" "RDK" "ECFP6" "FCFP4" \
    "TopologicalTorsion" "AtomPairs" "ECFP4" \
    "${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol"
    do
mkdir -p ${model_name}
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -u ${geminimol_app}/benchmark.py "${model_name}" "${geminimol_data}/benchmark.json"  "${task}"
done
done
```

> Benchmarking molecular fingerprints and GeminiMol on molecular property modeling

It is worth noting that different decoders exhibit varying performance on different tasks and encodings. Therefore, it is essential to select the appropriate decoder for each specific molecular encoder and task. In practice, we can determine when the model should stop-training and choose the optimal decoder architecture by dividing the training, validation and test sets. Consequently, all results should be merged using a data pivot table to analyze the optimal decoder for each encoder-task combination. In our work, the hyperparameters of the PropDecoder were chosen based on empirical experience and were not subjected to any hyperparameter tuning. Performing further hyperparameter tuning for each task may potentially yield improved performance.     

``` shell
for task in "ADMET-C" "ADMET-R" \
    "LIT-QSAR" "CELLS-QSAR" "ST-QSAR" "PW-QSAR" \
    "PropDecoder-ADMET" "PropDecoder-QSAR" # fixed the molecular encoder
    do
for model_name in "CombineFP" \
    "FCFP6" "MACCS" "RDK" "ECFP6" "FCFP4" "TopologicalTorsion" "AtomPairs" "ECFP4" \
    "${geminimol_lib}/GeminiMol"
    do
mkdir -p ${model_name}
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -u ${geminimol_app}/benchmark.py "${model_name}" "${geminimol_data}/benchmark.json"  "${task}"
done
